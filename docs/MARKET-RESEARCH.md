### E-Commerce Market

| Metric                        | Data                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SA online sales (2020)**    | ~$1.8 billion (R30 billion)                                       |

### WhatsApp Dominance

| Metric                        | Data                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WhatsApp users in SA**      | ~30 million+ (most-used messaging app in the country)              |
| **Usage pattern**             | #1 communication tool for business & personal use                  |
| **Commerce behavior**         | Traders already use WhatsApp for price lists, orders, and payments |
| **Business adoption**         | Wholesalers share catalogs via WhatsApp status & groups daily      |

### The Problem TradeFeed Solves

South African wholesalers and small retailers **already use WhatsApp** to discuss prices and place orders — but they do it **manually** with:
- Text messages
- Voice notes
- Screenshots of price lists
- Phone calls

This manual process leads to:
- ❌ Lost orders
- ❌ No order history or tracking
- ❌ No inventory visibility
- ❌ No analytics or reporting
- ❌ Time wasted on repetitive communication

**TradeFeed digitizes what they're already doing** — turning WhatsApp-shared catalogs into a professional, trackable ordering system.

## 3. Comparable Startups & Funding

These companies solve the **same problem** TradeFeed solves — connecting wholesalers with informal retailers in Africa:

| Startup        | Country          | Total Funding | What They Do                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **JABU**       | Namibia / SA     | **$18.2M**    | B2B ordering for 9,000+ merchants from wholesalers |
| **Wasoko**     | Kenya / E. Africa| **$125M**     | B2B supply chain for informal retailers            |
| **TradeDepot** | Nigeria          | **$110M**     | B2B ordering + BNPL for merchants                  |
| **MarketForce**| Kenya            | **$40M**      | Merchant ordering & last-mile distribution          |
| **MaxAB**      | Egypt            | **$40M+**     | B2B food & grocery wholesale marketplace            |
| **Chari**      | Morocco          | **$22M**      | B2B e-commerce for informal retail                  |
| **Omnibiz**    | Nigeria          | **$3M+**      | Digitizing informal B2B supply chain                |

### Total VC Investment in This Space: **$350M+**

> 💡 **Key Insight:** Investors have poured $350M+ into African B2B wholesale platforms. But **none of these are WhatsApp-first** — they all built native apps that require downloads. TradeFeed's WhatsApp-first, web-based approach is a unique advantage because SA informal traders already live on WhatsApp.

### Notable Investors in This Space

- **Tiger Global** — Led JABU's $15M Series A and Wasoko's $125M Series B
- **IFC (World Bank)** — Led TradeDepot's $110M round
- **Y Combinator** — Backed JABU at seed stage
- **Knife Capital** — SA VC with $50M fund specifically for high-exit-potential startups

## 4. Valuation Estimates

### SaaS Valuation Benchmarks

Early-stage B2B SaaS companies in emerging markets are typically valued at **8–15× Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)**.

| Stage                            | Revenue Multiple | If TradeFeed hits...    | Estimated Valuation     |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Pre-revenue (now)**            | Idea + MVP       | Working product, 0 ARR  | **R500K – R2M**         |
| **100 shops @ R199/mo**          | 10–15× ARR       | R240K ARR               | **R2.4M – R3.6M**      |
| **500 shops + marketplace fees** | 10–15× ARR       | R1.8M ARR               | **R18M – R27M**         |
| **2,000 shops + payments**       | 8–12× ARR        | R12M ARR                | **R96M – R144M**        |
| **10,000 shops (JABU-scale)**    | 8–10× ARR        | R60M+ ARR               | **R480M+**              |

### Revenue Model Assumptions

| Revenue Stream          | Pricing                    | Monthly Revenue (at 500 shops) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **SaaS subscriptions**  | R199 / R499 / R999 per mo  | ~R150,000                      |
| **Promoted listings**   | R50–R200 per boost          | ~R25,000                       |
| **Transaction fees**    | 2–3% per order              | ~R50,000+                      |
| **Payment processing**  | 1–2% margin on Yoco/PayFast| ~R20,000+                      |
| **Total estimate**      |                             | **~R245,000/mo (R2.9M ARR)**   |

### Comparison to JABU

JABU was valued at approximately **$40–50M (~R750M–R940M)** at their Series A with ~9,000 merchants. However, JABU is **inventory-heavy** (owns trucks, warehouses). TradeFeed is **pure SaaS** with near-zero marginal cost, which typically commands **higher multiples**.

## 5. Competitive Advantages

| Advantage                | Why It Matters                                                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WhatsApp-first**       | No competitor in SA is WhatsApp-first. JABU, Wasoko etc. all require app downloads. SA traders prefer WhatsApp. |
| **Multi-tenant SaaS**    | Each seller gets their own branded catalog — not a marketplace where they compete for visibility. |
| **Low cost to serve**    | No inventory, no logistics fleet, no warehouses. Pure software. JABU spends millions on trucks.  |
| **Already built**        | Working product deployed at trade-feed.vercel.app. Most startups at this stage are still wireframing. |
| **Mobile-first design**  | 66% of SA online purchases happen on mobile. The responsive design is production-ready.           |
| **Modern tech stack**    | Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Clerk Auth — scalable, maintainable, and fast.                      |
| **Marketplace effect**   | Built-in marketplace creates network effects — more sellers attract more buyers.                  |

### What Competitors Don't Have

## 9. Conclusion

### TradeFeed is positioned at the intersection of three massive trends:

1. **📱 Mobile commerce** — SA is mobile-first, and TradeFeed is built for it
2. **💬 WhatsApp commerce** — 30M+ users, and informal traders already order via WhatsApp
3. **🏪 B2B wholesale digitization** — $350M+ in VC funding proves this market is real

### The opportunity is clear:

- **Massive demand** — millions of traders ordering manually via WhatsApp
- **No direct competitor** — no WhatsApp-first wholesale catalog SaaS exists in SA
- **Proven revenue model** — SaaS + marketplace fees + transaction fees
- **Lean business** — pure software, no inventory or trucks needed
- **Venture-backed space** — Tiger Global, IFC, and YC are actively funding this exact problem

### Next steps:

1. Get the first **10 paying shops** to validate willingness to pay
2. Build **WhatsApp Business API** integration for automated order notifications
3. Integrate **Yoco or PayFast** for seamless payments
4. Prepare a **pitch deck** using the data in this report
5. Apply to **Y Combinator** (W2027 batch) or **Knife Capital** in SA
