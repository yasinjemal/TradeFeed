# TradeFeed — Product Vision

## One-Liner

Replace chaotic WhatsApp selling with structured digital catalog infrastructure for South African clothing wholesalers & retailers.

## Problem

Thousands of clothing wholesalers (Jeppe, Marble Tower, Cape Town CBD) sell via WhatsApp:

- Products are shared as loose images in group chats
- No structured catalog — buyers scroll endlessly
- Stock tracking is manual (mental, notebooks, or nothing)
- Orders come in as unstructured voice notes & texts
- Sellers lose sales because buyers can't find what's available
- No analytics, no reorder signals, no business intelligence

This is a **R50B+ informal trade sector** running on chaos.

## Solution

TradeFeed gives every wholesaler a **structured, mobile-first digital catalog** that:

1. Lets sellers upload products with variants (size, color) and stock levels
2. Generates a **public catalog page** (shareable link)
3. Enables buyers to browse, select items, and send a **structured WhatsApp order**
4. Keeps each seller's data **completely isolated** (multi-tenant)

**No payment processing. No chat system. No delivery tracking.**
Just the infrastructure upgrade from chaos → structured selling.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Mobile-first** — Sellers and buyers live on phones
2. **WhatsApp-native** — Meet users where they are
3. **Simplicity** — If a Jeppe trader can't use it in 2 minutes, it's too complex
4. **Isolation** — Every shop's data is sacred and private
5. **SA-first** — ZAR, POPIA, local payment rails, local language consideration
6. **Revenue-aware** — Every architecture choice supports future monetization
